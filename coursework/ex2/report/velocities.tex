Now that we've seen in part \ref{lbl:foxtarget} that the fox always runs towards some target. Furthermore, the rabbit perpetually runs towards its burrow. 

Therefore, we can say that a creature $C$ runs towards a target $T$ with a speed of $u$. We seek it's velocity in the $x$ direction ($v_x$) and in the $y$ direction ($v_y$).
