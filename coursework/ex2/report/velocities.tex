Now that we've seen in part \ref{lbl:foxtarget} that the fox always runs towards some target. Furthermore, the rabbit perpetually runs towards its burrow. 

Therefore, we can say that a creature $C$ runs towards a target $T$ with a speed of $u$. We seek it's velocity in the $x$ direction ($v_x$) and in the $y$ direction ($v_y$).

Figure \ref{fig:chasing} shows the scene. Using this we denote the angle between the creature and the target by $\theta$ and the distance between them by $\Delta$. We can then easily deduce that

$$ v_x = s\cos{\theta}, $$
$$ v_y = s\sin{\theta}. $$

Furthermore, we see there's no need to compute $\theta$, we can observe that 

$$ \cos{\theta} = \frac{\Delta_x}{\Delta}$$
$$ \sin{\theta} = \frac{\Delta_y}{\Delta}.$$

We can then combine these equations giving our final equations

$$ v_x = s \frac{\Delta_x}{\Delta},$$
$$ v_y = s \frac{\Delta_y}{\Delta}.$$

The advantage of using these equations rather than computing $\theta$ using trigonometry is that we can implement both components in one line using Octave's vector based arithmetic. This can be seen in our implementation in Listing \ref{}.
