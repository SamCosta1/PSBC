We can use an event function to stop the computation when our computation is complete. Two events should stop the calculation, the fox catching the rabbit, and the rabbit reaching the burrow.

We will use a similar approach for both. The rabbit is considered caught if it is within 0.1 meters of its burrow. Similarly, it is deemed to be in its burrow if it is within 0.1 meters of it.

Let the distance between the fox and the rabbit be $\Delta_{f,r}$. Our event function should trigger the ODE solver to stop when $\Delta_{f,r}$ becomes less than 0.1. In other words when $\Delta_{f,r} - 0.1$ becomes negative. The case when the rabbit reaches the burrow is similar. The implementation is listed in Listing \ref{lst:stopEvent}.
